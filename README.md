# ML--Decision-Tree
# Decision Tree for Classification & Regression 

A decision tree is essentially a series of if-then statements, that, when applied to a record in a data set, results in the classification of that record. Therefore, once you've created your decision tree, you will be able to run a data set through the program and get a classification for each individual record within the data set. What this means to you, as a manufacturer of quality widgets, is that the program you create from this article will be able to predict the likelihood of each user, within a data set, purchasing your finely crafted product.

# How decision tree works
The understanding level of Decision Trees algorithm is so easy compared with other classification algorithms. The decision tree algorithm tries to solve the problem, by using tree representation. Each internal node of the tree corresponds to an attribute, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label.

# How to split nodes
There are few algorithms to find optimum split. Let's look at the following to understand the mathematics behind.
